# Knockout Tournament Tracker

## Project overview

This project is a dynamic Python application that manages a knockout tournament. It allows the user to input any number of teams (minimum 4), automatically generates matches, handles byes when necessary, records match results (with scores), and displays an updated leaderboard after each round. The tournament progresses through rounds until a champion is crowned.

## Learning objectives

In this project, students learn to:

* Implement a software solution based on a detailed Software Design Specification (SDS).
* Apply modular programming principles to structure a Python application.
* Use control structures (selection, iteration) and functions effectively.
* Perform input validation and error handling.
* Manage data using appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries).
* Track tournament progression, including byes and match results.
* Implement and update a leaderboard that reflects team performance after each round.

## Setup instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knockout-tournament-tracker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd knockout-tournament-tracker
```

3. Open `starter_code.py` in your preferred Python IDE.

4. Run the program:

```bash
python starter_code.py
```

## Project structure

* `Software_Design_Specification.pdf`: Detailed specification document outlining functional requirements, pseudocode, DFDs, and validation rules.
* `starter_code.py`: Skeleton Python code to get started, with modular function placeholders.
* `LICENSE`: Open-source license file.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Tasks

* Complete all functions in `starter_code.py` according to the SDS.
* Maintain a logbook of development progress.
* Prepare a testing report with at least 6 test cases, covering typical and edge cases.
* Provide a code trace for one function/module.
* Submit screenshots of the leaderboard after at least one full tournament run.

## Resources

Refer to the SDS for detailed requirements and pseudocode. Submit all completed work via Canvas LMS by the due date listed in your assessment notification.
